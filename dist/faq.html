                                No! This is one of PictriKit's key features. All image processing happens locally in your web browser using JavaScript. Your screenshots never leave your device, are not uploaded to our servers, and are not stored anywhere except on your own computer. This ensures complete privacy and security for your sensitive screenshots.

                                Yes! Since all processing happens locally in your browser and nothing is uploaded to our servers, PictriKit is safe for confidential, sensitive, or private screenshots. Your data never leaves your device.

                                Yes! Crop operations are fully integrated with the undo/redo system. Simply press Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on Mac) to undo a crop, or use the Undo button in the toolbar. You can undo multiple times to go back through your editing history.

                                Absolutely! You can crop the same image multiple times to refine your selection. Each crop operation builds on the previous one, allowing you to progressively trim the image to exactly what you need. If you make a mistake, just use Ctrl+Z to undo.

                                Currently, PictriKit doesn't have a built-in save/load project feature. However, you can download intermediate versions of your work as you progress. We're considering adding project save functionality in a future update. If this feature is important to you, please <a href="/contact.html">let us know</a>!

                                Performance depends on your device's capabilities and the size/number of images you're working with. To improve performance: (1) Close other browser tabs and applications, (2) Use smaller image files when possible, (3) Reduce the number of screenshots on the canvas, (4) Try using a different browser, or (5) Restart your browser to free up memory.

                                There's no artificial file size limit imposed by PictriKit. The practical limit depends on your device's available memory and browser capabilities. Most modern devices can handle images up to 10-20 MB without issues. Very large images (50+ MB) may cause performance problems or browser crashes.

                                Try these solutions: (1) Verify your file format is supported (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP), (2) Check that the file isn't corrupted by opening it in another program, (3) Try a different upload method (drag-drop instead of clicking), (4) Refresh the page and try again, (5) Try a different browser, or (6) Clear your browser cache and cookies.
